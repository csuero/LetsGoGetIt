# Let's Go Get It: *Front-end*

## Insight 
For the fron-end part of the project, the idea was to create a website that would bring the best possible experience to the different users of the platform:
ranging from customers and partners to staff members, the main focus is for each user to be able to quickly get information that is relevant to their needs. 
May it be retrieving information about an order or placing a request (and seeing the request from the staff side.)

As per client request, the web app was built taking inspirations from [Backpacks.com](http://backpacks.com).

## Libraries
Besides the usual implementation of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, some of the libraries that are used on the front-end part are:

* [** Bootstrap **](https://getbootstrap.com)

In order to make the website to load as responsive as possible in the different devices and screen sizes that it could be accessed, 
Bootstrap was chosen because of its ease of use and integrations to almost any middleware service. Built on CSS and JavaScript, it provides a set of tools designed
to provide with a responsive design framework for the site. Another advantage is that given that more than millions of devices use it, the loading times can be 
almost negligible, as it could be cached on the accessing computer.

* [** Litera **](https://bootswatch.com/litera/)

As mentioned previously, the website's design was inspired from [backpacks.com](backpacks.com). Literal, a bootstrap-based template, was chosen for its minimalistic and easy to focus design
While keeping the information centered and the overall site not too cluttered.
    

### Live Prototype

This prototype was built using Adobe XD as the main application, due to both simple yet powerful interface, in addition to having the ability to create integrate transitions into designs to create an almost 'usable' version.

To make our design much easier, some existing wireframes were used:

 * [** Adobe XD Dashboard **](https://www.behance.net/gallery/60714355/FREE-Dashboard-UI-Kit-for-Adobe-XD)
 
 * [** Wires: Adobe XD Kit **](https://www.behance.net/gallery/55462459/Wires-wireframe-kits-for-Adobe-XD)
 
Elements of these wirekits were picked to create the best fit between readability, usability, and realistic implementation in the future.
