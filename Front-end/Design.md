# Design

Instead of going for a Write-First, Test-Second approach, it was determined that creating a prototype instead of live coding would be more efficient on the long run,
as changes can be easily made to a design. Plus, it was much easier to coordinate and to make sure that the requirements are met



## Requirements 
The general outline is to make the website's users aware that they can request the current location of their items (tracking)

* The user can view the order confirmation screen and review all order details. 
* The user can watch and following the movement of their order with either static or live GPS tracking.
* The user can view and select several delivery options with different prices.



## Shared Pages
Some of the pages on the app are shared across all users, as they don't contain information that is tied to a user's account. 
However, these pages could display information to the user in the form of alert or pop-ups.


### Landing Page

As the overall idea for the project is to connect the customer to the tracking of their shipments.
Because of that, one of the main areas for the landing page is the tracking button.
